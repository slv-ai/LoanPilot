# LoanPilot
AI-powered loan underwriting using multi-agent orchestration with LangGraph + Next.js

## What is LoanPilot?
LoanPilot is a multi-agent AI system that automates loan underwriting decisions. Instead of a single AI making one call, 4 specialist agents run in parallel — each analyzing a different dimension of the application — then a judge agent synthesizes a plain-English verdict for the loan officer to review.
What used to take days now takes under 10 seconds.
